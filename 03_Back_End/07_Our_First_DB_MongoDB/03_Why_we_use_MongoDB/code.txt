I) Why we are learning MongoDB?
    1) Mongo is very commonly used with Node and Express (MEAN and MERN stacks)
    2) It is easy to get started with (though it can be tricky to master)
    3) It plays particularly well with JavaScript 
    4) It's popularity also means there is a strong community 
    of developers using Mongo. 

II) Side note
    1) Learn a SQL DB within the next yr.
