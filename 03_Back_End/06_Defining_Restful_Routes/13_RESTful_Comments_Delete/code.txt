I) Prework
    1) Last task is to set up a destory path
    2) Like the PATCH request we can't send a DELETE request with a form.

II) index.js
    1) Change our const comments array into let comments 
    2) Add the following below app.patch 

app.delete("/comments/:id", (req, res) => {
  const { id } = res.params;
  comments.filter((c) => c.id !== id);
  res.redirect("/comments");
});

III) show.ejs 
    1) Add the follow below our edit comment button 

<form method = "POST" action="/comments/<% commment.id %>?_method=DELETE">
    <button>Delete</button>
 </form>

IV) What to do next
    1) Build out a Full CRUD app with something other than comments
