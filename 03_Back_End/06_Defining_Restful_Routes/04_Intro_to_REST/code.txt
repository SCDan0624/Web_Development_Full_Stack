I) What is REST
    1) REST is basically a set of guidlines for how a client + server
    should communicate and perform CRUD operations on a 
    given resource

    2) The main idea of REST if treating data on the sever-side as 
    resources than can be CRUD'ed 

    3) The most common way of approaching REST is in formatting the URLs
    and HTTP verbs in your applications.
