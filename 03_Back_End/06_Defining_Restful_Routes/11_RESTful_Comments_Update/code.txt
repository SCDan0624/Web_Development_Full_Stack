I) Prework
    1) PUT vs PATCH 
        A) PUT is going to update an entire thing. Replacing 
        all representations.

        B) PATCH is going to update something via partial 
        modification

II) index.js 
    1) Add the following 

app.patch("/comments/:id", (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const newCommentText = req.body.comment;
  const foundComment = comments.find((c) => c.id === id);
  foundComment.comment = newCommentText;
  res.redirect("/comments");
});

    2) Breakdown 
        A) const { id } = res.params;
            i) taking the id from the URL 

        B) const newCommentText = req.body.comment;
            i) taking whatever was sent in the req.body (the comment payload)

        C) const foundComment = comments.find((c) => c.id === id);
            i) finding a comment hopefully with the id of the url 

        D) foundComment.comment = newCommentText;
            i) We then update the foundcomment's comment property 
            to be whatever was in req.body.comment 

        E) res.redirect("/comments");
            i) redirect back to index page


III) What we are missing
    1) A form to actually edit our comments which will be in the next 
    lesson
