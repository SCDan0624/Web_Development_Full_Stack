I) Prework
    1) Current Problem
        A) After submitting our comment we are shown a page that
        states "It Worked!"
            i) To get to our comments page we need to hit enter,
            which sends a GET requests and redirects us.
            ii) Hitting refresh would resend another POST request 
            causing our comment to be posted twice
        
        B) We need the page to redirect us to our page that is displaying
        comments 

    2) Fix 
        A) res.redirect([status,]path)

II) index.js 
    1) Add the following line to our app.post(/comments):

        res.redirect("/comments");

III) index.ejs 
    1) Add the following below our ul 

        <a href="/comments/new">New Comment</a>

IV) new.ejs
    1) Add the following below form 

        <a href="/comments">Back to Index</a>
