I) Delete Form
    1) show.ejs 
        A) Add 

    <form action="/products/<%=product._id%>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
        <button>Delete</button>
    </form>

            i) method override is needed here since we can't normally send DELETE 
            requests in forms 

II) Delete Route
    1) index.js 
        A) Add 

app.delete("/products/:id", async (req, res) => {
  res.send("You made it!!");
});

    2) Test
        A) Go to a product on localhost/3000/products/
        B) Click on product 
        C) Hit delete button 
        D) You made it should appear

    3) index.js 
        A) Add/edit 

app.delete("/products/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const deletedProduct = await Product.findByIdAndDelete(id);
  res.redirect("/products");
});

III) Full Test 
    1) Go to products 
    2) Click on product you want to delete 
    3) Click on delete button
