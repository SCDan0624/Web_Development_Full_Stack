<h1>Chicken</h1>
<p>
  The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is
  a type of domesticated fowl. Chickens are one of the most common and
  widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
  2018, [1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in
  the world than any other bird.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source
  of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.
  Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were
  not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).[3][4]
