I) Create our own middleware
  1) index.js 
    A) Add 

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("This is my first middleware");
  next();
});

  B) Note 
    i) By adding return next() you guarentee no code in that 
    specific app.use will be run.

II) Test 
  1) localhost:3000/dogs 
    A) Our console.log will show up in the terminal only.
